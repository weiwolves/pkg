// ToUTF8MB4 converts MySQL compatible databases from utf8 to utf8mb4. Whatâ€™s
// the difference between utf8 and utf8mb4? MySQL decided that UTF-8 can only
// hold 3 bytes per character. Why? No good reason can be found documented
// anywhere. Few years later, when MySQL 5.5.3 was released, they introduced a
// new encoding called utf8mb4, which is actually the real 4-byte utf8 encoding
// that you know and love.
//
// # Run this once on each schema you have (Replace database_name with your schema name)
// ALTER DATABASE database_name CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
//
// # Run this once for each table you have (replace table_name with the table name)
// ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
//
// # Run this for each column (replace table name, column_name, the column type, maximum length, etc.)
// ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE column_name column_name VARCHAR(191) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
